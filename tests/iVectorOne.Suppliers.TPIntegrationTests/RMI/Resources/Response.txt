            <Description>Palm Island Resort is an eco-friendly, Green Globe certified island with a dash of sophistication.  The luxury, all-inclusive, 135-acre resort offers a range of amenities, activities, dining options and accommodations. &#xD; &#xD; Palm Island is located near the southern tip of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, a chain of 32 islands and cays known for natural beauty and clear, tranquil waters. The area&#x2019;s abundant sea life, coral reefs and unique shipwrecks attract recreational sailors and divers from around the world. &#xD; &#xD; Palm Island does not accept bookings that include children younger than 12 years old.&#xD; &#xD; GETTING THERE&#xD; Flights from Barbados to Union Island, plus onward travel by boat to Palm Island, are included within your accommodation price. Currently flights run daily from BGI. &#xD; &#xD; WHAT&#x2019;S NEW	&#xD; Recently, Palm Island Resort was named the number four resort in the Caribbean in the Cond&#xE9; Nast Traveler Readers&#x2019; Choice Awards.    &#xD; Over the past year, all aspects of the resort&#x2019;s culinary experience have been upgraded, including menu offerings, presentation and service.  The resort&#x2019;s menu changes based on season and availability, incorporating locally grown herbs and produce, some of which are from the on-property greenhouse.  These ingredients are also used in new flavour-infused waters and cocktails.  This chilled, naturally flavoured water as well as frozen fruit popsicles are served during peak hours each day at the beach and along pool areas.  &#xD; &#xD; Another new local food and beverage initiative is the resort&#x2019;s coconut program.  With more than 2,000 coconut-bearing trees spread across the 135-acre island, Palm Island naturally provides a seemingly endless supply of coconuts.  This local, naturally beneficial product is now harvested and incorporated into the daily rotating menu.  Sample breakfast items include coconut-flavored bread, waffles and pancakes.  Lunch and dinner items include coconut rice and peas, coconut shrimp, coconut layer cake, coconut macaroons and more, all made with local Palm Island coconuts.&#xD; &#xD; New offerings have also been added to the daily activity program and excursions, including volleyball and cricket matches, a presentation on the history of the island and weekly receptions.  For action-seeking guests, the thrill of kitesurfing and the beauty of stand-up paddle boarding are also available. &#xD; &#xD; The resort has also added an informal weekly sunset photo contest.  Guests gather each evening at the Sunset Bar to watch the western sky as the sun dips below the horizon.  Photos taken by guests&#x2019; cameras are submitted for a friendly competition, and a winner is selected each week.&#xD; &#xD; ACCOMMODATION&#xD; Ideal for romantic escapes, girlfriend getaways, mother-daughter retreats as well as solo travelers, this intimate hideaway has only 41 guestrooms and two private villas. More than half of the 43 are set directly on the beach while the rest are located just a few steps away.  	&#xD; &#xD; All accommodations provide the following in-room amenities:  air conditioning; soft bathrobes; daily housekeeping service; nightly turndown service; personal safe; hair dryer; coffee maker; alarm clock; iron; and ironing board.  In addition, all beachfront rooms are now outfitted with glass shutters.  &#xD; &#xD; A TV, computer and Internet lounge is available for guests, who may also bring their own laptops and take advantage of WiFi access.&#xD; &#xD; Palm View rooms have sitting areas, furnished terraces, two queen-sized beds or a king-sized bed (some with canopies) and master baths (some with deep-soaking tubs).&#xD; &#xD; Beach Front rooms have king-sized beds, furnished terraces with views of the Caribbean Sea and Union Island, small sitting areas and bathrooms with showers.
